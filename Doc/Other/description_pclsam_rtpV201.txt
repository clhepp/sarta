Introduction:
------------
This documentation is a supplement to the standard "description.txt"
file included on the standard SARTA v1.08 package, and consists of a
brief decription of PCLSAM related features not present in the
standard SARTA.

The PCLSAM variant of SARTA can be used to calculate the approximate
radiance of a field of view containing up to two clouds.  The clouds
may be transmissive and scattering, or black.  The quality of the
calculations is rather crude, particularly the scattering component.

There are two versions of the PCLSAM variant code:
   1) sarta_pclsam_slabcloud
   2) sarta_pclsam_100layercloud (not yet updated to rtpV201)
The slab cloud variant works with clouds defined by a top and bottom
pressure and a single total cloud amount and mean particle size.  The
100 layer cloud variant uses cloud amount (and optionally cloud particle
size) profiles specified on the 100 layer AIRS grid.

The PCLSAM codes make use of lookup tables for various cloud properties.
These properties vary depending upon the types of particles making up
the clouds, eg water droplets, ice aggregates, smoke, dust, et cetera.
A separate set of lookup tables is required for each cloud particle type.
Black clouds do not require lookup tables.


RTP v201 Cloud Fields:
---------------------
RTP v201 is designed for up to two clouds.  There are 9 cloud
fields for each cloud
   cfrac : fraction of FOV containing this cloud
   ctype : cloud type code number; see "cloud_type_code.txt"
   cprtop: cloud top pressure
   cprbot: cloud bottom pressure
   cngwat: total amount of cloud particles
   cpsize: mean size of cloud particles
   cemis: cloud surface emissivity
   crho: cloud surface reflectivity
   cstemp: cloud surface temperature
The first cloud uses these fields, while the second cloud
uses similarly named fields except with a "2" at the end.  In
addition, there is one more field for the overlap of both clouds
   cfrac12: fraction of FOV containing both clouds

NOTE: SARTA will attempt to do a cloud calculation if the
cloud fraction is greater than zero, and not otherwise.  It
will inter-compare the three cloud fractions to make sure
they are valid and report any logical inconsistency.


Cloud Types:
-----------
Cloud particle types are specified using a cloud type code number. This
code number is used to control which of the lookup tables are used.
See file "cloud_type_code_numbers.txt" for our recommended numbering
system.  You are free to use some other numbering system, but you
should be aware of the following:
a) If you specify a code number for which there is no exact match
   in the lookup tables, the code will use the nearest available lookup
   table which falls within the same "century" (span of 100) as the
   requested code number. For example, if you have lookup tables
   {101, 170, 203} and request 199, the code will use the table
   for 170 for 199.
b) The code interprets all cloud type code numbers less than 100 as
   a black cloud.

Due to finite computer memory, the code is ordinarily compiled with
a limited selection of cloud particle types.  The number of cloud
types is specified in the include file "incFTC.f" by variable NMIETY,
while the corresponding lookup table filenames and cloud type code
numbers are set in include file "fnmie.f".


Black Clouds:
------------
Black clouds are non-transmissive and non-scattering; they are
treated as a surface at the specified cloud top pressure. Black
clouds are indicated by any "ctype" < 100, and require the
following info:
   ctype: cloud type code number
   cfrac: cloud fraction {0.0-1.0}
   cprtop: cloud top pressure >= PROF.spres {hPa}
   cemis: emissivity
   crho: reflectance
   OPTIONAL cstemp: surface temperature {K}
If cstemp <=0 then the surface temperature is interpolated from
the layer temperatures to cprtop.

If two clouds are specified (cfrac & cfrac2 > 0), then
cfrac12 must also be specified.  A black cloud may not be
OVER (higher altitude & lower pressure) a transmissive
cloud unless cfrac12=0.  There is no such restriction if
the black cloud is UNDER the transmissive cloud.

Non-required cloud fields are not used and have no effect.


Slab Cloud:
----------
Slab clouds are one of our two SARTA implmentations of
transmissive and scattering clouds, the other being 100 layer
clouds.  Unlike 100 layer clouds, slab clouds do not use cloud
profiles; rather the cloud is defined by a top and bottom
pressure and total absorber amount. Slab clouds require the
following info:
   ctype : type code number
   cfrac : fraction {0.0-1.0}
   cprtop: cloud-top pressure {hPa}
   cprtop: cloud-bottom pressure {hPa}
   cngwat: water/whatever amount {g/m^2}
   cpsize: particle size {um}

If two clouds are specified (cfrac & cfrac2 > 0), then
cfrac12 must also be specified.

Non-required cloud fields are not used and have no effect.


100 Layer Cloud:
---------------
Cloud profiles are specified on the same 100 AIRS layers as
the air temperature and atmospheric gas amounts.  Cloud amount
profiles must be in units of g/m^2 (HEAD.gunit = 5), while
cloud particle size must be in units of um (HEAD.gunit = 55).
The gas IDs are expected to be 201 (IDCLD1) for cloud 1
gas amount and 301 (IDCLD1+IOFFP) for particle size, while
cloud2 uses 202 amount and 302 particle size. (IDCLD1, IDCLD2,
and IOFFPS are set in include incFTC.f").

NOTE: the 100 layer SARTA code has not yet been updated to
use rtpV201.  Not sure when I'll get to it.


Cloud Fraction:
--------------
With a single cloud, the radiance is a weighted sum of radiances
for the clear portion of the FOV and the cloudy portion.
   fraction-clear
   fraction-cloud1
The sum of these two fractions must equal one.

With two clouds, the total radiance is a weighted sum of radiances for:
   fraction-clear
   fraction-cloud1-only
   fraction-cloud2-only
   fraction-cloud1-and-cloud2
The total sum of these four fractions must equal one.  For the case
of two black clouds, fraction-cloud1-and-cloud2 should be zero as
radiance can not pass thru a black cloud.

When dealing with two clouds, the SARTA code treats "prof.cfrac" as
the total fraction of the FOV containing cloud1, which includes any
overlap with cloud2 as specified by cfrac12.  A similar consideration
applies to fraction for cloud2.  The fractions of the FOV containing
only cloud1 and cloud2 are thus
   fraction-cloud1-only = cfrac  - cfrac12
   fraction-cloud2-only = cfrac2 - cfrac12


Lookup Tables:
-------------
The cloud lookup tables are read by routine "rdcldt.f".  For each
cloudy particle type, this reads one set of lookup tables consisting
of three files
   1) Absorption
   2) Extinction
   3) Asymmetry ("G")
Each file contains a small header and a 2D table of the above named
parameter value as a function of instrument channel (ie frequency)
and particle size.  All three files must contain the same number of
particle sizes, but different sets of lookup tables may have
different numbers of sizes. The maximum allowed number of sizes
is specified in include file "incFTC.f" by variable MXMIEA.
