Here are some notes on the non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium algorithm
used with our AIRS fast model.  Scott.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To implement the nonLTE model in the SARTA code, I had to write a
new routine:
   calnte.f - calculates the nonLTE radiance contribution
and modify some old routines:
   rdcoef.f - read in nonLTE coefficients
   sarta.f - add nonLTE coefs to rdcoef call and add calnte call
and add a few new lines to the include file:
   incFTC.f - specify the nonLTE coef file and array size

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our preliminary testing of the October 2005 nonLTE fast model with the
"calnte.f" DRAD fudge factor set to 1.20 looks promising.  The following
jpeg files show some results for clear FOVs over-ocean.

Focus day 27 July 2005 results (30000 day and 10000 night FOVs):
   nonLTE_mean.jpg      - mean of BT_Obs - BT_Cal, (K)
   nonLTE_std.jpg       - std dev of BT_Obs - BT_Cal, (K)
   nonLTE_668vs2361.jpg - histogram of BT_Obs - BT_Cal for two channels at
                             668 and 2361 cm^-1 (ID 79 & 2081).  These two
                             channels have similar weighting functions.  The
                             2361 cm^-1 channel is blue(night) and red(day),
                             and the 668 cm^-1 channel is cyan(night) and
                             magenta(day).

There is not much to the fast model non-LTE.  Here's a
description.

  R_chan_lte = integral{ R_lte(v) * f(v) * dv }

where R_lte(v) is the monochromatic upwelling radiance at the top of
an atmosphere in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, f(v) is the SRF for
the channel, and the integral is over the spectral interval of the
channel v_min to v_max.

R_chan_nonlte is similarly defined except it is for an atmosphere
in non-LTE.

We already have a fast model which can compute the approximate
R_chan_lte for an arbitrary profile, but the non-LTE calculation
is significantly more complex.  However, this complexity of the
calculation does not necessarily translate into a complexity of
the effect.  That is, while it calculation is complex, it may be
possible to approximate the result by a more simple means.

Now we define

   delta_R_chan_nonlte = R_chan_nonlte - R_chan_lte

which is simply the difference in radiance as seen by the observing
instrument between the atmosphere in nonLTE and LTE conditions.

We can re-arrange terms to get

   R_chan_nonlte = R_chan_lte + delta_R_chan_nonlte

Thus if there is an easy way to model delta_R_chan_nonlte, we will
easily be able to calculate R_chan_nonlte with our fast model.

We can calculate R_chan_lte and R_chan_nonlte with our monochromatic
code "kCARTA" code, and convolve them with the AIRS SRFs to get
R_chan_lte and R_chan_nonlte.  We can do this for an ensemble of
profiles at multiple viewing angles and sun angles.  With such a
database, we can then calculate delta_R_chan_nonlte.  Finally,
we do a regression to relate delta_R_chan_nonlte to a set of
predictors.

   A * X = delta_R_chan_nonlte

where A is a matrix of preditors, and X are the coefficient
determined by regression.  The predictors were chosen by
trial-and-error, starting from a list of plausible terms.
Here is what we are using for out AIRS fast model:

1) 1
2) suncos
3) suncos^2
4) suncos * viewsec
5) suncos * Thi
6) suncos_surf

suncos = sun angle cosine at top AIRS layer
viewsec = view angle secant at top AIRS layer
Thi = mean temperature in the top five AIRS layers
suncos_surf = sun angle cosine at the surface.
