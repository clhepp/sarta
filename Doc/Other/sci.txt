Introduction:
------------
The September 2002 SARTAv1.03 package is very similar to our
previous SARTAv1.02 package.  The main change is new RTA
coefficients for the "m135f" (-13.5 um with fringes) channel
set.  This is the calibrated channel set as of 18 August 2002.
Some relatively minor changes were made to some source code
routines (calpar.f & sunpar.f and  calt1.f thru calt7.f) to
accomodate changes made to the water continuum.
 
The SRFs for this package are based on the SRF model at
T_grating=155.1325 K with y-offset -13.50 um, and fringes
for T_filter=156.157 K.

Note: there is some indication that the channel center
frequencies for AIRS module M-5 (1100 cm-1 region) may be off
by around -3 um (ie might be -10.5 instead of -13.5 um).  We
are currently investigating this issue.


Overview of the Method:
----------------------
Our fast transmittance model is based on methods developed and used by
Larry McMillan, Joel Susskind,  and others.  An introduction to the
theoretical development of the approximations employed can be found in:
   "Atmospheric Transmittance of an Absorbing Gas: A Computationally Fast
   and Accurate Transmittance Model...", Larry M. McMillin and Henry E.
   Fleming, Applied Optics, vol 15 no 2, February 1976, pages 358-363.
and for OPTRAN in:
   "Atmospheric Transmittance of an Absorbing Gas 5.  Improvements to
   the OPTRAN Approach", L.M. McMillin, L.J. Crone, and T.J. Kleespies,
   Applied Optics, vol34 no36, December 1995, pages 8396-8399.

Briefly, an outline of the method we employed is:

[a.] Select the Regression Profiles:
   We chose 48 regression profiles which cover the realistic range of profile
   variability.  Each profile consists of temperature and gas amounts of 4
   variable gases: water, ozone, carbon monoxide, and methane.  All other
   gases are "fixed" (do not vary in amount with profile).

[b.] Calculate Monochromatic Transmittances:
   Monochromatic layer-to-space transmittances for the regression profiles
   are computed.  This was done using our KCARTA v1.01 package.  The layer-
   to-space transmittances are grouped into sets of "mixed" gases.  For
   this production, there were 4 different ways in which the gases were
   grouped, depending upon the frequency region:
      FOW  : 3 groups of transmittances: F, FO, FOW
      FOWp : 4 groups of transmittances: F, FO, FOW, FOWp
      FMW  : 3 groups of transmittances: F, FM, FMW
      FCOWp: 5 groups of transmittances: F, FC, FCO, FCOW, FCOWp
   where F refers to "fixed" gases, W to water, O to ozone, C to carbon
   monoxide, and M to methane.  The "p" refers to perturbed CO2, in which
   the CO2 amount has been increased by +5%.  Thus "FM" refers to the
   transmittance of the "fixed" gases and methane together.

   For channels under 1620 cm-1, we did 6 angles with secants:
      1.00  1.19  1.41  1.68  1.99  2.37
   For the shortwave channels we did 6 additional angles to extend out
   to the larger angles need for the for reflected solar radiance:
      2.84  3.47  4.30  5.42  6.94  9.02

[c.] Convolve the Transmittances:
   The monochromatic transmittances are convolved with the AIRS Spectral
   Response Functions.  For this production run, there was a separate SRF
   for each of the AIRS channels.  The SRFs are based upon laboratory
   measurements of the SRFs.  In particular, we used interpolations of
   measurements for test 261, with the wings added on using a model.  The
   channels in module 11 which are based on test 266 due to noise problems
   with test 261 for that module.

[d.] Calculate Efffective Layer Tranmittances:
   For each layer, the convolved layer-to-space transmittances are ratioed
   with transmittances in the layer above to form effective layer
   transmittances for fixed, water, ozone, CO, methane, and perturbed
   CO2 are:
   For FOW:
      Feff(L) = F(L)/F(L-1)
      Oeff(L) = ( FO(L)/F(L) )/( FO(L-1)/F(L-1) )
      Weff(L) = ( FOW(L)/FO(L) )/( FOW(L-1)/FO(L-1) )
    For FOWp:
      Feff(L) = F(L)/F(L-1)
      Oeff(L) = ( FO(L)/F(L) )/( FO(L-1)/F(L-1) )
      Weff(L) = ( FOW(L)/FO(L) )/( FOW(L-1)/FO(L-1) )
      peff(L) = ( FOWp(L)/FOW(L) )/( FOWp(L-1)/FOW(L-1) )
   For FMW:
      Feff(L) = F(L)/F(L-1)
      Meff(L) = ( FM(L)/F(L) )/( FM(L-1)/F(L-1) )
      Weff(L) = ( FMW(L)/FM(L) )/( FMW(L-1)/FM(L-1) )
   For FCOWp:
      Feff(L) = F(L)/F(L-1)
      Ceff(L) = ( FC(L)/F(L) )/( FC(L-1)/F(L-1) )
      Oeff(L) = ( FCO(L)/FC(L) )/( FCO(L-1)/FC(L-1) )
      Weff(L) = ( FCOW(L)/FCO(L) )/( FCOW(L-1)/FCO(L-1) )
      peff(L) = ( FCOWp(L)/FCOW(L) )/( FCOWp(L-1)/FCOW(L-1) )
   The 0th layer transmittance (ie when L-1=0) is taken to be exactly 1.0.

[e.] Do a Regression on the Effective Layer Transmittances and Predictors:
   The effective layer transmittances are converted to absorption coefficient
   (by taking the minus logarithm), and then weighted according to some
   estimated relative importance.  A regression is done on this data with
   a set of profile dependent predictors (see note below) as the independent
   variables.  The regression, which is of the form A*X=B, where A is a matrix
   of predictors and B is the data, calculates X, the fast transmittance
   coefficients.

   Note: The predictors are generally various combinations of the main profile
   variables such as the temperature and gas amount, as well as the satellite
   viewing angle.  One of the most time consuming and tiring aspects in
   developing a fast model using this method is in selecting/inventing the
   optimum set of predictors.  It is essentially a trial and error exercise;
   try somthing an see how it works.

The fast transmittance coefficients may be used to quickly compute effective
layer transmittances for almost any desired profile simply by calculating
the appropriate predictor values for the profile and multiplying them by the
coefficients.  In our AIRS model, the individual component gases ("fixed",
water, ozone, CO, methane, and the far-wing water continuum) are calculated
separately.  The total layer transmittance is the product of the individual
component transmittances.

The only part of this process supplied with this package is the code to do
a demonstration of the transmittance calculation discussed in the proceeding
paragraph.  The heart of this package is the fast transmittance coefficients
(a set of of numbers) and the code ("calpar.f") describing how the predictors
are calculated.  Everything else is relatively unimportant.


The Regression:
--------------
The regression to determine the fast transmittance coefficients was carried
in FORTRAN using LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) routines to solve an equation
of the form A*X=B by the method of Q-R factorization. Something on the order
of 1 million regressions are necessary: 2378 channels with 3 or 4 gases and
100 layers (300 levels for the OPTRAN water calculations).  The maximum number
of predictors used for each regression was determined by the number of data
points, the layer number, the maximum value of the data, and the relative
value to the data compared to data for the other gases.

A regression was done using the maximum number of predictors, and the RMS
fitting errors of the optical depths (unweighted) was then calculated. The
number of predictors was then reduced by one and another regression done. The
RMS results were then compared to the RMS results of the previous regression.
If the RMS error was less than 2% worse than the regression with the maximum
number of predictors, this procedure was repeated until the RMS error got
large (or we were down to only one predictor).  The last regression meeting
the 2% criteria was the one saved to output.

    -----------------------------------------------------

Angles:
The local path angle is subtended by the Earth outward normal at the point the
satellite is looking at, and the ray from the point the satellite is looking
at back to the satellite. A simple equation (based on the satellite's altitude,
the Earth's radius, and the approximate layer altitude) can convert between
this angle and the AIRS satellite viewing angle.  See routine VACONV.

Fixed:
Once calculated as described above, the effective layer optical depth for the
"fixed" gases may be multiplied by FIXMUL(L) to account for minor variations
in "fixed" gas amount.  It takes account of the effects of water vapor
displacement of fixed gases, as well as minor variations in profile layer
thickness (which are profile and latitude dependent).

Water:
The effective layer transmittance for water only covers the near wing portion
of the water line absorption; the far wing portion (defined as that part of
the lineshape more than 25cm-1 from line-center) is handled with the water
continuum fast model.  The continuum is slowly varying with frequency compared
to the AIRS SRF, and so it may be approximated as a constant over a single
AIRS channel.  In other words, the effective continuum transmittance can be
well approximated by the monchromatic continuum transmittance, as so the
water continuum can be handled separately from the other gases.

For ease of implementation, a fast model has been developed for the far wing
water continuum.  It is based on a regression of kCARTA computed water
continuum using the CKD version 2.4 continuum model.  Estimated accuracy of
the fast model is within ~2% of the kCARTA calculation.

For some of the water channels we have used the OPTRAN method to model the
water optical depths.  This has been restricted to only those channels where
the method resulted in an improvement in accuracy.


Variable CO2:
------------
The transmittance of a "standard" CO2 profile is included in the
"fixed" gases transmittance.  The standard profile is 370 ppmv
mixing ratio for all layers (except for the top few where it
starts to dip down towards slightly).  370 ppmv is the approximate
expected global average CO2 mixing ratio in 2001.

Using a separate set of coefficients & predictors, we have modeled
the effect upon the total transmittance of a small change in the
CO2 mixing ratio.  For a change in CO2 of just a few percent, the
change in total optical depth varies almost linearly with the CO2
perturbation.  This fact is the basis of the fast model variable
CO2.  The coefficients are actually for one particular perturbation
in CO2, and we simply linearly scale the calculations to adjust
them for the desired perturbation.

The variable CO2 is only accurate for small changes in CO2 mixing
ratio.  There are no hard limits, but -6 to +6 % is a reasonable
range.  It will handle larger changes, but accuracy drops off.
