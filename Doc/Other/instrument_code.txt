Instrument Code Numbers
***********************
Last updated: Scott Hannon, 23 July 2001

The RTP format includes a code number which may be used to specify
the particular instrument used for the radiances observations (if
any).  There are separate entries for the IR and MW instruments.

The following system of code numbers is suggested.  Each instrument
type is assigned ID code number N x100.  All numbers between N*100
and (N+1)*100 - 1 correspond to the same basic instrument type, but
allows for up to 100 copies/versions of the basic instrument.
Individual instruments within types with multiple copies can be
assigned their own unique code number.  The first copy is 1, later
additional copies are number sequentially in chronological order of
deployment.  Or, if an instruments already has a familar 1 or 2
digit ID number, that number can be used.

The following lists may be missing some instruments; extend
the lists as you see fit.

Specific IR Instruments
-----------------------

HIRS code 100:  ~20 channels with ~10 cm-1 resolution using separate
   interference filters for each channel.  Satellite instrument.
   There are approximately a dozen HIRS instrument.  HIRS instruments
   have been flying on NOAA's POES platforms since 1978 and some of the
   older instruments are no longer in service.  New HIRS instruments
   continue to enter service as part of the POES TOVS instrument
   package.  Over the years there have been some changes in the
   instrument details, so they are not all exactly alike.
   100 = generic HIRS
   101 - 104 = reserved
   105 = NOAA N (original)
   106 = NOAA 6
   107 = NOAA 7
   108 = NOAA 8
   109 = NOAA 9
   110 = NOAA 10
   111 = NOAA 11
   112 = NOAA 12
   113 = NOAA 13
   114 = NOAA 14
   115 = NOAA 15 (aka K)
   116 = NOAA L
   117 = NOAA M
   118-120 = reserved for future NOAA operated HIRS nstruments
   121 - 199 = available


HIS code 200:  ~1 cm-1 resolution FTIR instrument, 600-3000 cm-1.
   Aircraft instrument without cross-track scanning.  As far as I know,
   all HIS instruments have been operated by University of Wisconsin,
   Madison.  I'm not sure how many have been built (and rebuilt), but
   somewhere around 3.  I think some one or more have been extensively
   rebuilt and thus may warrant a separate code number for the rebuild.
   200 = generic HIS
   201-209 = reserved for U.Wisconsin
   210-299 = available


AERI code 300: ~1 cm-1 resolution FTIR instrument, 500-3000 cm-1.
   Usually operated from the surface looking upward.  There are
   currently approximately a dozen AERI instruments in use, and a
   few more are expected to enter service over the next few years.
   Known (albeit vaguely) instruments include:
   300 = generic AERI
   301-305 = ARM/CART Southern Great Plains (SGP) facilities located in
      Oaklahoma & Kansas.  Currently operating 5 instruments:
      301 : central facility CF-1 in Lamont, Oaklahoma
      302 : north boundary facility BF-1 in Hillsboro, Kansas
      303 : south boundary facility BF-6 in Purcell, OK
      304 : west boundary facility BF-4 in Vici, OK
      305 : east boundary facility BF-5 in Morris, OK
   306 = ARM/CART Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) facility located
      on the island nation of Nauru.
   307 = ARM/CART North Slope of Alaska (NSA) facility located in
      Barrow(?), Alaska.   This AERI has extended spectral range. 
   308 = ARM/CART SHEBA ice station located somewhere on floating
      ice in the Arctic ocean.
   309-319 = reserved for future ARM/CART AERI instruments
   320-325 = reserved for University of Wisconsin, Madison.  (I'm
      unsure of how many instruments they operate...two?)
   326 = University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).  This
      instrument is owned by faculty member Wallace McMillan.
      This instrument is semi-mobile.  It's usual location is
      beneath a hatch in the roof of the physics building.
   327 = Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii (big island), Hawaii.
       This instrument is owned by UMBC faculty member
       Larrabee Strow, and operated with the help of NOAA's
       ETL group.
   330-335 = three (?) instruments operated by U.Miami?

IMG code 400: ~0.1 cm-1 resolution FTIR satellite instrument,
   600 - 2700 cm-1 range.  Amazing resolution but short lived.
   The first instrument was on the Japanese ADEOS satellite
   which died suddenly after just a few months of service.
   400 = generic IMG
   401 = first (and only?), on ADEOS
   402 = second?
