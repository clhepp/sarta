SARTA: StandAlone Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Algorithm

This is the UMBC Atmospheric Spectroscopy Laboratory's SARTA radiative transfer algorithm.  It was developed for the AIRS sensor flying on NASA's EOS-AQUA platform.  Versions for METOP's IASI instrument, and the NASA/NOAA SNPP/JPSS CrIS instrument are also available.  

For further information, please contact L. Strow, strow@umbc.edu.

Note, this FORTRAN77 version uses the old VAX F77 structure extensions, so it will not work out of the box on most free FORTRAN90 compilers.  It does compile on most commercial comilers, we use ABSOFT.  We hope to fix this limitation soon.
