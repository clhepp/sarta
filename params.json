It was developed for the AIRS sensor flying on NASA's EOS-AQUA platform.  Versions for METOP's IASI instrument, and the NASA/NOAA SNPP/JPSS CrIS instrument are also available.  \r\n\r\nYou cannot use this code without the associated RTA parameterization files. For further information, and for the location of the parameterization files please contact L. Strow, strow@umbc.edu.\r\n\r\nNote, this FORTRAN77 version uses the old VAX F77 structure extensions, so it will not work out of the box on most free FORTRAN90 compilers.  It does compile on most commercial comilers, we use ABSOFT.  We hope to fix this limitation soon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
